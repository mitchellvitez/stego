Steganography is a way to hide information such that it can move around undetected. This lightning talk explores some of the history of and techniques for doing so.

Usage
-----

To start decoding some messages, run

`python <X>.py < files/<X>.txt`

where `<X>` is the name of the steganographic method you want to use (nullcipher, lookalike, etc.)

Notes
-----

You will need the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) to run insignificant.py
